/**
  * Euler Problem 22 - Names scores
  *
  * Using [src/main/resources/euler22], a 46K text file containing over five-thousand
  * first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
  * alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position
  * in the list to obtain a name score.
  *
  * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
  * 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a
  * score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
  *
  * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
